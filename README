Digital Photo Editing and Drawing is one of those multimedia applications which require a lot of user interactions 
to achieve a given task.This proposal is for a multi-touch based photo manipulator and drawing application that 
would take advantage of the speedier,fewer and more intuitive inputs of a multi-touch surface thus enhancing the 
productivity of the user.

The focus is to explore new interactions & developing UI widgets for PyMT framework which would be reusable for 
other applications.
