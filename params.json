This proposal is for a multi-touch based photo manipulator and drawing application that would take advantage of the speedier,fewer and more intuitive inputs of a multi-touch surface thus enhancing the productivity of the user.\r\n\r\nThe focus is to explore new interactions & developing UI widgets for PyMT framework which would be reusable for other applications.\r\n\r\n![Demo](http://db.tt/bKOJUW1i)\r\n\r\nTo put it simple NUIPaint is a photo editing/drawing software built to utilize multi-touch input capabilities of modern hardware.Its an on going project with 0.1 version being just released.\r\n\r\n##Introduction\r\n\r\nThe 0.1 Version consists of following features:<br/>\r\n\r\n* Support for editing wide range of filetypes(Pyglet core)\r\n* Support for collaborative editing (Multiple Window)\r\n* Multitouch Gestures based interface\r\n* Support for super fast GLSL Filters\r\n* Support for Layer based editing\r\n* Copy/Cut/Paste Support\r\n* Wide range of brushes\r\n\r\nOriginally hosted [here](http://nuicode.com/projects/gsoc-nuipaint)","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
